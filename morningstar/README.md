The purpose of this project was to emulate a broad global ETF using a combination of more specific 401k funds. More generally, it can be used to determine the allocations of a collection of funds needed to emulate another fund by performing linear algebra on the MorningStar style boxes of the funds. For example: what percent of the SP 1500 is the SP 500, SP 400, and SP 600?

To run this project, run `MorningStarTargetCalculator` and set the `INPUT_BOXES` and `TARGET_BOX` variables to the desired values.
